## Analysis of Lariat Car Rental data.

This is a Portfolio Project created as a part of attending Thinkful to obtain a certificate in Data Analysis

In this project I peformed an analysis of business data for the fictional company "Lariat Rent-A-Car".

Data was contained in a series Excel files which need to be combined in order perform analysis.

I chose at that point to utilize python and pandas to import the files into a series of data frames which I then used to create two data frames of tidy data. The first containing each individual transaction for the company and a second containing only the fleet data.

This data was then exported into two seperate sheets within a single Excel files in order to create a workbook that could be presented to the company, as well as the slides for an accompanying PowerPoint presentation.

The biggest challenge in this project was that the ficticious nature of the data meant it didn't follow the sort of patterns I would expect to find in actual data. For examples, average profits by branch and by car model year were almost identical, there was almost no variation in sales by day of week, etc. 

Rather than ignore this oddity, I chose to consider what it would mean if I were actually given real, verifiable business data that produced these sorts of numbers.

This then led to the conclusion that the company's fleet was so far below demand that the individual cars and branches had essentially become fungible. The reccomendation given to the company then was that fleet must be increased, and most likely increased considerably. While this could be done through trial and error, it was reccomended either that they seek out more detailed data regarding what their competitors are doing or bring in outside consults with broad knowledge of the rental car industry in order to help determine purchase amounts.
